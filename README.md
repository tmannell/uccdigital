# UCC Digital Theme

This repo contains a custom Omeka theme built for the United Church of Canada Archives' digital archiving platform.

## My Role
I was responsible for designing and developing the frontend theme, ensuring alignment with accessibility standards and user requirements provided by the UCCA team.

This repo reflects the theme files required for the Omeka CMS. Planning and additional implementation details were handled outside of this repository.

## Note
This work was part of a broader digital preservation initiative by the United Church of Canada Archives.
